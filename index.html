    <div class="about">
    <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
     <p>
        I am a cybersecurity student and systems engineer in progress, driven by a commitment to protect, innovate, and serve. 
        My portfolio reflects not just technical proficiency in network design, system integration, and troubleshooting, but a 
        deeper mission: to lead with integrity, connect people through cutting-edge technology, and build solutions that are as 
        ethical as they are efficient. By blending faith with functionality, I aim to create systems that uplift, secure, and 
        sustain communitiesâ€”digitally and spiritually.
     </p>
    </div>

    <div class="about">
    <h2>Vision</h2>
      <p>Over the next five years, I envision myself growing into a leadership role as a systems administrator or systems engineerâ€”someone who architects and maintains secure, scalable, and user-friendly infrastructure. I aim to become a key contributor to environments that demand both high assurance and real-world accessibility, whether in enterprise networks or mission-driven organizations.</p>

      <p>As I advance professionally, I plan to specialize in centralized authentication, automated system hardening, and regulatory compliance frameworks such as CMMC. But my work will be grounded in more than just technical capabilityâ€”it will reflect my ethical commitment to clarity, accountability, and responsible innovation.</p>

      <p>My technical writing coursework and system documentation efforts have reinforced that ethics in IT is not abstractâ€”itâ€™s visible in how systems are built, how users are supported, and how transparency is maintained. I intend to carry this mindset into every deployment, guide, and conversation.</p>

      <p>I also see community impact as inseparable from professional growth. I plan to:</p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <li>Publish clear, accessible infrastructure guides to demystify secure system setups</li>
        <li>Mentor students and early-career professionals on aligning security practices with ethical standards</li>
        <li>Contribute to open-source projects that value transparency and practical usability</li>
        <li>Support nonprofits and small businesses by creating sustainable, documented security solutions<br></br></li>
      </ul>

      <p>In short, I want to help build a culture where systems are not just secureâ€”but understandable, inclusive, and trustworthy.</p>

     <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
         Hi there! I'm Preston, currently studying Cybersecurity at Ensign College with an expected graduation date of April 
         2026. While my academic journey began with a focus on securing networks and building policies, my internship experience 
         lit a spark in a different directionâ€”one that blends creativity, engineering, and problem-solving.
         </p>
        <p>
         Iâ€™ve found my calling in system administration and engineering, where I get to design network architectures, work with 
         new hardware, and dive into the ever-evolving tech ecosystem.
         </p>
         <p>
         I thrive on solving complex puzzlesâ€”whether itâ€™s integrating fresh hardware into a home lab setup or troubleshooting 
         systems until every component works harmoniously. Iâ€™m deeply motivated, self-taught in many areas, and currently 
         building out a home lab that includes plans for a fully-authenticated Plex streaming environment. I love tinkering, 
         learning, and imagining better ways technology can work together seamlessly.
         </p>
        <p>
          As I continue to grow, Iâ€™m excited to explore projects that push boundariesâ€”blending creativity with technical depth. 
          Whether youâ€™re here to check out my work or collaborate on something awesome, welcome!
        </p>
