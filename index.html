    <div class="about">
    <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
     <p>
        I am a cybersecurity student and systems engineer in progress, driven by a commitment to protect, innovate, and serve. 
        My portfolio reflects not just technical proficiency in network design, system integration, and troubleshooting, but a 
        deeper mission: to lead with integrity, connect people through cutting-edge technology, and build solutions that are as 
        ethical as they are efficient. By blending faith with functionality, I aim to create systems that uplift, secure, and 
        sustain communities—digitally and spiritually.
     </p>
    </div>

    <div class="about">
    <h2>Vision</h2>
      <p>Over the next five years, I envision myself growing into a leadership role as a systems administrator or systems engineer—someone who architects and maintains secure, scalable, and user-friendly infrastructure. I aim to become a key contributor to environments that demand both high assurance and real-world accessibility, whether in enterprise networks or mission-driven organizations.</p>

      <p>As I advance professionally, I plan to specialize in centralized authentication, automated system hardening, and regulatory compliance frameworks such as CMMC. But my work will be grounded in more than just technical capability—it will reflect my ethical commitment to clarity, accountability, and responsible innovation.</p>

      <p>My technical writing coursework and system documentation efforts have reinforced that ethics in IT is not abstract—it’s visible in how systems are built, how users are supported, and how transparency is maintained. I intend to carry this mindset into every deployment, guide, and conversation.</p>

      <p>I also see community impact as inseparable from professional growth. I plan to:</p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <li>Publish clear, accessible infrastructure guides to demystify secure system setups</li>
        <li>Mentor students and early-career professionals on aligning security practices with ethical standards</li>
        <li>Contribute to open-source projects that value transparency and practical usability</li>
        <li>Support nonprofits and small businesses by creating sustainable, documented security solutions<br></br></li>
      </ul>

      <p>In short, I want to help build a culture where systems are not just secure—but understandable, inclusive, and trustworthy.</p>

     <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
         Hi there! I'm Preston, currently studying Cybersecurity at Ensign College with an expected graduation date of April 
         2026. While my academic journey began with a focus on securing networks and building policies, my internship experience 
         lit a spark in a different direction—one that blends creativity, engineering, and problem-solving.
         </p>
        <p>
         I’ve found my calling in system administration and engineering, where I get to design network architectures, work with 
         new hardware, and dive into the ever-evolving tech ecosystem.
         </p>
         <p>
         I thrive on solving complex puzzles—whether it’s integrating fresh hardware into a home lab setup or troubleshooting 
         systems until every component works harmoniously. I’m deeply motivated, self-taught in many areas, and currently 
         building out a home lab that includes plans for a fully-authenticated Plex streaming environment. I love tinkering, 
         learning, and imagining better ways technology can work together seamlessly.
         </p>
        <p>
          As I continue to grow, I’m excited to explore projects that push boundaries—blending creativity with technical depth. 
          Whether you’re here to check out my work or collaborate on something awesome, welcome!
        </p>
