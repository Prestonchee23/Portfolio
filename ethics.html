            <h3>Scenario Overview</h3>
            <p>
                During a past project, I encountered an ethical dilemma involving 
                the handling of a client’s confidential data. 
                A team member proposed using real customer data in a staging 
                environment to accelerate development and testing.
                While this would have been more convenient, it violated privacy 
                protocols and potentially breached data handling policies.
            </p>

            <h3>Ethical Principles Involved</h3>
            <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
                <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Respecting client data privacy.</li>
                <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Doing what is right even when it’s 
                    inconvenient.</li>
                <li><strong>Responsibility:</strong> Upholding professional and legal 
                    obligations in data handling.<br></br></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Proposed Alternative</h3>
            <p>
                Instead of using real customer data, I proposed generating synthetic 
                data that mirrored the structure and complexity
                of the real dataset. This approach allowed us to preserve privacy 
                while still testing effectively. 
                It took more effort, but protected client information and complied 
                with our ethical standards.
            </p>

            <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
            <p>
                The alternative solution emphasized that convenience should never outweigh
                ethical responsibility. 
                By prioritizing security and trust, we not only avoided legal risks but 
                also set a higher standard for the team.
                These moments have helped shape my understanding of how IT professionals
                must serve as guardians of integrity in our field.

         <h3>Internship: Handling Sensitive Customer Data During Testing<br></br></h3>
            <p>During my Mathew Made Construction internship, I encountered an ethical challenge 
                involving customer data privacy. Real customer data was proposed for network 
                security testing, which risked exposing sensitive information.<br></br>
            </p>
            <p>I recommended using synthetic or anonymized data for testing instead, ensuring that 
                testing was effective without compromising privacy. Working with supervisors, we 
                implemented data masking policies and strict access controls during testing.<br></br>
            </p>

            <p>This experience taught me the importance of balancing technical needs with ethical 
                responsibilities, especially around protecting confidential information.
            </p>
