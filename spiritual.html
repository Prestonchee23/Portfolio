         <h4>Becoming Through Christlike Discipleship</h4>
        <p>Life is not just about what I accomplish, but about who I am becoming. Elder Dallin H. Oaks 
          taught that the gospel is designed to shape who we become, not merely to govern what we do. 
          In my cybersecurity journey, technical skills are important, but qualities like patience,
           humility, and diligence are essential for a reliable professional and leader. Maintaining 
           composure and showing respect for others is as essential as technical knowledge in creating 
           a vibrant workplace. As I advance in this course and my career, I’m excited to intentionally 
           cultivate Christlike qualities in my project management, conflict resolution, and team
            leadership, enriching our collaborative journey.</p>

        <h3>Honoring Sacred Covenants in All Aspects of Life</h3>
        <p>The principle that the Savior's Atonement isn't just for repentance, but also a source of 
          daily strength, healing, and enabling power, has been a crucial concept in my life. Whether I am 
          at school, work, or just in my personal life, each comes with its own set of challenges. There 
          have been days when I feel stretched a little too thin or unsure if I can keep up with 
          expectations. It's moments like these that I rely on Christ's Atonement to help give me the 
          resilience, clarity, and peace I need. Professionally, this reminds me that I don't need to be 
          perfect or have all the answers. Because mistakes and setbacks are inevitable, I can continue to 
          move forward, learn, and improve thanks to the Atonement of Christ. This principle has helped 
          guide me in striving to be spiritually grounded, even in demanding work environments.</p>

         <h4>Becoming Through Christlike Discipleship</h4>
        <p>My temple covenants are a foundational part of who I am. They remind me of my eternal identity 
          and the responsibilities that come with it. In every setting — whether church, home, or 
          workplace — I want those sacred commitments to shape my choices. In cybersecurity trust and 
          integrity are non-negotiable. Being able to handle sensitive information and secure a network
          environment requires the use of integrity, including honesty, discretion, and a commitment to
          protect others. The covenants I make help me maintain a higher standard in these areas of 
          responsibility. This principle helps me to remain accountable not only to employers and 
          clients but also to the Lord, ensuring that my career and discipleship stay in harmony.</p>

         <h4>Ether 12:27 — Strength Through Weakness</h4>
        <p>This scripture has anchored me during moments of technical struggle—especially when 
          something in the lab wasn’t working, or I hit a wall diagnosing a system issue. In my home 
          lab experiments and internship trials, I’ve found that growth often came not from success, 
          but from wrestling with failure. Ether 12:27 reminds me that weakness isn’t 
          disqualifying—it’s refining. It encourages me to approach problems with humility and patience, 
          knowing Christ can transform weakness into strength when I’m willing to keep trying and 
          leaning on Him.

        <span class="close" data-close>&times;</span>
         <h4>Way to Be – Gordon B. Hinckley</h4>
        <p>Hinckley's book became a compass early in my journey. The simplicity and clarity of his "nine 
          Be’s" stood out: Be Humble, Be Prayerful, Be Positive. As I built out my professional skills, 
          like conducting risk assessments and implementing STIG compliance, it struck me that technical 
          excellence means little without a moral compass. Each “Be” encourages me to navigate the 
          cybersecurity world with a kind of ethical intentionality, like keeping user privacy at the 
          forefront or advocating honesty in reporting vulnerabilities.

         <h4>Temple Worker Experience</h4>
        <p>Becoming a temple worker wasn’t just a title, it was a transformational responsibility. There 
          were quiet lessons in reverence, stewardship, and consistency. This calling showed me the value 
          of sacred duty, and I’ve carried that sense of stewardship into how I handle sensitive systems 
          and data. When I was building out Active Directory environments or establishing VPNs, I wasn’t 
          just doing technical work, I was honoring a covenant of trust.

         <h4>"Behold Thy Mother" – Jeffrey R. Holland</h4>
        <p>One part of this talk that truly struck me was Elder Holland's gentle reminder: “You are doing 
          better than you think you are.” That single phrase pierced through the noise of self-doubt I’ve 
          felt in school, work, and life. It reminded me that progress isn't always visible, and that my 
          efforts—even when imperfect—are noticed by heaven. In my cybersecurity coursework and hands-on 
          labs, there are times I wonder if I’m keeping up, doing enough, or reaching the level I aspire to. 
          Elder Holland’s words reassured me that the Lord sees the small victories I often overlook. <br></br>
          This talk has increased my compassion toward others, as well as an understanding that everyone is doing their 
          best in ways we may never know. When it comes to supporting those around me, whether it be in troubleshooting 
          or writing documentation for less technical users, I want to be the kind of person who sees potential and 
          encourages growth.

         <h4>D&C 122:7 — Trials Are Temporary</h4>
        <p>This verse has been a personal lifeline for me. When deadlines loom, troubleshooting becomes 
          overwhelming, or life throws curveballs, I return to this. In the semesters when I have been 
          overwhelmed, the counsel that the Lord gave to Joseph Smith has always inspired me to keep 
          moving and trust that good things are to come nothing is permanent except for grace. It’s helped 
          me reset when I’ve struggled to balance faith, school, and work.
