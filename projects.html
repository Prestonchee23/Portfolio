    <h3>Mathew Made Construction Internship</h3>
    <p>
        During my internship, I faced and overcame many real-world networking challenges. I 
        was responsible for building and troubleshooting a secure remote access system, 
        where I diagnosed and resolved intermittent internet connectivity issues. I configured
        VLANs to segment guest and internal traffic, which required extensive troubleshooting 
        and fine-tuning of routing between the switch and firewall.<br><br>
    </p>

    <p>
        In addition to VLAN setup, I worked directly with the companyâ€™s firewall to manage 
        security rules and remote access settings, and I configured a network-attached storage 
        (NAS) system to support data backup and sharing across departments. I also set up and 
        optimized a managed Layer 2 switch to support Power over Ethernet (PoE) and ensure 
        proper traffic flow between devices.<br><br>
    </p>

    <p>
        As part of a broader cybersecurity initiative, I contributed to the companyâ€™s efforts to 
        achieve Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) Level 1 compliance. This 
        involved reviewing and aligning system configurations with compliance requirements and 
        helping to draft clear security policies and procedures.<br><br>
    </p>

    <p>
        These hands-on experiences helped me build a deeper understanding of enterprise 
        networking, system configuration, and security best practices. I am currently developing 
        documentation to support these systems and contributing to the creation of incident 
        response plans and security policies to further strengthen the companyâ€™s cybersecurity posture.<br><br>

    <h3>Hybrid Cloud Backup Proposal</h3>
    <p>
      I led the design and proposal of a hybrid backup solution combining local NAS storage with Google Workspace cloud services to provide scalable, secure, and cost-effective data protection for Mathew Made Construction. The solution balanced offline access for critical files with cloud-based scalability during peak seasonal demands.<br><br>
      Key challenges included optimizing budget constraints while ensuring data reliability, security (with MFA, VPN, and encryption), and disaster recovery capabilities. I conducted thorough technical research, analyzed cost-benefit trade-offs, and developed governance and security policies.<br><br>
      This project honed my skills in critical thinking, technical evaluation, and professional proposal writing, resulting in a comprehensive plan that aligned with company needs and emphasized efficiency and security.

    <h3>Windows 11 STIG Compliance</h3>
    <p>
      As part of a comprehensive cybersecurity initiative, I conducted a detailed security audit on a company's Windows 11 network infrastructure, evaluating compliance against Microsoft's Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIG) SCAP Benchmark. My role involved scanning systems for vulnerabilities, analyzing compliance gaps, and prioritizing risks through a structured risk register.<br><br>
      Key challenges included addressing critical issues such as unencrypted drives, weak authentication protocols, and insecure remote access configurations, and effectively communicating these technical risks to non-technical stakeholders.<br><br>
      Based on the findings of this assessment, I collaborated with a team to develop a tailored Corporate Security Policy aligned with the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Critical Security Controls framework. The policy addressed areas such as remote access, VPN usage, data protection, and incident response, with particular emphasis on securing cloud services and remote connections essential to the company's daily operations.<br><br>
      This project strengthened my skills in technical auditing, risk assessment, policy development, and cross-functional communication. The outcome was a clear, actionable security improvement plan and corporate policy framework that significantly enhanced the organization's security posture while supporting business continuity.

    <h3>Active Directory Environment</h3>
    <p>
      I was responsible for building and configuring an Active Directory environment with multiple client machines. I implemented user authentication, group policies, and organizational units to simulate a realistic enterprise network.<br><br>
      A significant challenge was troubleshooting group policy conflicts and ensuring secure access control. Through this project, I enhanced my skills in Windows Server administration, network security, and system troubleshooting. The outcome was a fully functional directory service demonstrating core enterprise functions.

    <h3>Phishing Email Server & Exploit</h3>
    <p>
      In this penetration testing project, I developed a phishing email server that targeted simulated users with crafted emails to test security awareness. I also exploited a Windows Server Certificate Authority to decrypt user certificates, demonstrating weaknesses in certificate management.<br><br>
      Overcoming challenges in setting up the environment and safely executing exploits required attention to detail and ethical responsibility. This experience improved my understanding of attack vectors and the importance of user education in cybersecurity defense.

    <h3>Smart Card Authentication</h3>
    <p>
      I built a secure authentication system using smart cards, including setting up a Certificate Authority, issuing certificates, and configuring login processes with multi-factor authentication.<br><br>
      Challenges included managing certificate lifecycles and ensuring compatibility with client machines. This project deepened my knowledge of PKI, authentication protocols, and enterprise security infrastructure. The successful deployment demonstrated the effectiveness of smart card-based authentication in enhancing user security.
