    <h2>Mathew Made Construction Internship<br></br></h2>
      <h3>Overview:</h3>
      <p>During my internship, I faced and solved a lot of real-world networking challenges. I was responsible for 
        building and troubleshooting a secure remote access system, diagnosing and fixing intermittent internet 
        connectivity issues. I configured VLANs to separate guest and internal traffic, which involved detailed 
        troubleshooting and fine-tuning routing between the switch and firewall.<br></br></p>

      <p>Besides VLAN setup, I worked directly with the company’s firewall to manage security rules and remote access. 
        I also configured a network-attached storage (NAS) system to support data backup and sharing across 
        departments. To keep everything running smoothly, I set up and optimized a managed Layer 2 switch that supports 
        Power over Ethernet (PoE), ensuring proper traffic flow between devices.<br></br></p>

      <p>As part of the company’s push toward Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) Level 1, I helped 
        review system setups to meet compliance requirements and assisted in drafting clear security policies and 
        procedures.<br></br></p>

      <p>These hands-on experiences gave me a solid understanding of enterprise networking, system configuration, and 
        security best practices. I’m also working on documentation and helping create incident response plans and 
        security policies to further improve the company’s cybersecurity.<br></br></p>

    <h3>Hybrid Cloud Backup Proposal<br></br></h3>
    <p>
      <h3>Overview:</h3>
      I led the design and proposal of a hybrid backup solution for 
      Mathew Made Construction, integrating local NAS storage with 
      Google Workspace cloud services. The goal was to deliver 
      scalable, secure, and cost-effective data protection that 
      supported both offline access to critical files and cloud-based 
      scalability during peak seasonal demands.
      To meet these objectives, I conducted in-depth technical research, 
      evaluated multiple backup architectures, and developed governance 
      and security policies tailored to the company’s operational needs. 
      The solution emphasized disaster recovery readiness, secure remote 
      access, and budget-conscious implementation.<br></br>

      <h3>Complex Challenges Faced:</h3>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <li>Balancing cost constraints with high availability and data reliability</li>
        <li>Designing a hybrid architecture that supported both local and cloud-based access</li>
        <li>Implementing security measures including multi-factor authentication (MFA), VPN access, and encryption</li>
        <li>Evaluating trade-offs between performance, scalability, and long-term maintenance</li>
        <li>Aligning technical recommendations with business priorities and seasonal workflows<br></br></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Ethical Considerations and Actions Taken:</h3>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <li>Ensured all data handling practices complied with internal security policies and privacy standards</li>
        <li>Recommended encryption and access control policies to protect sensitive company data</li>
        <li>Maintained transparency in cost-benefit analysis to support informed decision-making</li>
        <li>Avoided vendor lock-in by proposing flexible, interoperable solutions<br></br></li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Outcomes:</h3>
       <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <li>Delivered a comprehensive backup proposal aligned with company goals and budget</li>
        <li>Strengthened disaster recovery capabilities and data security posture</li>
        <li>Gained experience in technical evaluation, proposal writing, and stakeholder communication</li>
        <li>Helped lay the groundwork for scalable infrastructure improvements<br></br></li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Windows 11 STIG Compliance<br></br></h3>
    <p>
      As part of a comprehensive cybersecurity initiative, I conducted a detailed security audit on a company's Windows 11 network infrastructure, evaluating compliance against Microsoft's Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIG) SCAP Benchmark. My role involved scanning systems for vulnerabilities, analyzing compliance gaps, and prioritizing risks through a structured risk register.<br><br>
      Key challenges included addressing critical issues such as unencrypted drives, weak authentication protocols, and insecure remote access configurations, and effectively communicating these technical risks to non-technical stakeholders.<br><br>
      Based on the findings of this assessment, I collaborated with a team to develop a tailored Corporate Security Policy aligned with the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Critical Security Controls framework. The policy addressed areas such as remote access, VPN usage, data protection, and incident response, with particular emphasis on securing cloud services and remote connections essential to the company's daily operations.<br><br>
      This project strengthened my skills in technical auditing, risk assessment, policy development, and cross-functional communication. The outcome was a clear, actionable security improvement plan and corporate policy framework that significantly enhanced the organization's security posture while supporting business continuity.

    <h3>Active Directory Environment<br></br></h3>
    <p>
      I was responsible for building and configuring an Active Directory environment with multiple client machines. I implemented user authentication, group policies, and organizational units to simulate a realistic enterprise network.<br><br>
      A significant challenge was troubleshooting group policy conflicts and ensuring secure access control. Through this project, I enhanced my skills in Windows Server administration, network security, and system troubleshooting. The outcome was a fully functional directory service demonstrating core enterprise functions.

    <h3>Phishing Email Server & Exploit<br></br></h3>
    <p>
      In this penetration testing project, I developed a phishing email server that targeted simulated users with crafted emails to test security awareness. I also exploited a Windows Server Certificate Authority to decrypt user certificates, demonstrating weaknesses in certificate management.<br><br>
      Overcoming challenges in setting up the environment and safely executing exploits required attention to detail and ethical responsibility. This experience improved my understanding of attack vectors and the importance of user education in cybersecurity defense.

    <h3>Smart Card Authentication<br></br></h3>
    <p>
      I built a secure authentication system using smart cards, including setting up a Certificate Authority, issuing certificates, and configuring login processes with multi-factor authentication.<br><br>
      Challenges included managing certificate lifecycles and ensuring compatibility with client machines. This project deepened my knowledge of PKI, authentication protocols, and enterprise security infrastructure. The successful deployment demonstrated the effectiveness of smart card-based authentication in enhancing user security.
