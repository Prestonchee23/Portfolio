    <h2>Mathew Made Construction Internship<br></br></h2>
      <h3>Overview:</h3>
      <p>During my internship, I faced and solved a lot of real-world networking challenges. I was responsible for 
        building and troubleshooting a secure remote access system, diagnosing and fixing intermittent internet 
        connectivity issues. I configured VLANs to separate guest and internal traffic, which involved detailed 
        troubleshooting and fine-tuning routing between the switch and firewall.<br></br></p>

      <p>Besides VLAN setup, I worked directly with the company’s firewall to manage security rules and remote access. 
        I also configured a network-attached storage (NAS) system to support data backup and sharing across 
        departments. To keep everything running smoothly, I set up and optimized a managed Layer 2 switch that supports 
        Power over Ethernet (PoE), ensuring proper traffic flow between devices.<br></br></p>

      <p>As part of the company’s push toward Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) Level 1, I helped 
        review system setups to meet compliance requirements and assisted in drafting clear security policies and 
        procedures.<br></br></p>

      <p>These hands-on experiences gave me a solid understanding of enterprise networking, system configuration, and 
        security best practices. I’m also working on documentation and helping create incident response plans and 
        security policies to further improve the company’s cybersecurity.<br></br></p>
